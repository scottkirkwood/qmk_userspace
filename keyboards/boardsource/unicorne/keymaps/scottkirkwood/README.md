This keyboard combines whe seems to be common Corne layouts with the Kinesis
Advantage

Key differences:

-   I use CapsLock as Ctrl on all keyboards, so the leftmost middle key is Ctrl,
    but also doubles as ESC
-   Tab is top left instead of escape
-   Hyphen is top right instead of backspace
-   Backspace is middle left thumb button, similar to Kinesis, but doubles as
    Lower when held
-   A second spacebar is the middle right thumb button, similar to Kinesis, but
    doubles as Raise when held
